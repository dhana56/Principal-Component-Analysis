#### This repository is an example that showcases how can we do dimensional reduction by keeping the information of the data by using Principal Component Analysis(PCA).

### Important Steps for PCA analysis: 
   > 1. Standardization of the data 
   >
   > 2. Finding the Corresponding Eigenvalues and Eigenvector of the data
   >
   > 3. selecting the optimal number of required eigenvectors(Principal Components) that keep the major information of the data
   >
   > 4. Transforming the input data matrix into the selected number of eigenvectors's dimensions.   
   >  
   > 5. Plotting the PCA data

> Before running the Jupyter file, you have to run the [requirement.txt](requirement.txt) file for the required Python libraries.
  pip install requirement.txt
